Customer churn poses a major threat to revenue stability and long-term business sustainability in the telecom industry. The organization is experiencing increasing customer attrition and lacks clear insight into why customers are leaving, which segments are most affected, and what actions can reduce churn.
This project was designed to identify churn drivers, high-risk customer segments, and actionable retention opportunities using data analytics and visualization.
